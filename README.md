# Cron-Expression-Parser
This Bash script is designed to parse and expand cron strings, providing a clear breakdown of each component within a cron job definition. Cron strings specify when scheduled tasks should run on Unix-like operating systems, and this script helps users understand these definitions by translating them into easily readable formats.
