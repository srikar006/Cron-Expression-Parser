# Cron-Expression-Parser
Description
This Bash script is designed to parse and expand cron strings, providing a clear breakdown of each component within a cron job definition. Cron strings specify when scheduled tasks should run on Unix-like operating systems, and this script helps users understand these definitions by translating them into easily readable formats.
Key Features:
Cron Field Expansion: The script can handle various types of cron field inputs, including:
Wildcard charecter (e.g: *)
Step values (e.g: */5)
Ranges (e.g: 1-5)
Comma-separated values (e.g: 0,15)

Formatted Output: It displays the expanded values in a tabular format, making it easy to interpret the scheduling details.  How to Use It
Clone or Download: Get this script onto your machine.
Make It Executable: Run the command: chmod +x cron_expression_parser and check the rwx permissions of the file whether it’s executable or not 
Usage Guidance: If the user provides an incorrect number of arguments, the script prompts with usage instructions to ensure proper execution.
It shows an actual user guidance format like: Usage: ./cron_expression_parser.sh '<cron_string>'
Usage: 
Run the script with a cron string as an argument. For example:
./cron_expression_parser.sh “*/15 0 1,15 * 1-5 /usr/bin/find” 
The output will detail the expanded values for each component of the cron string, including minutes, hours, days of the month, months, days of the week, and the command to execute.
Example Output:
For the input cron string “*/15 0 1,15 * 1-5 /usr/bin/find ”, the script will produce output like: 
This makes it easier for users to understand when their scheduled tasks will run, ensuring they can manage their cron jobs more effectively.
